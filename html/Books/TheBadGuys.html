They sound like the Bad Guys, they look like the Bad Guys....and they even smell like the Bad Guys. The main characters are a wolf, a shark, a snake and a piranha. They have always been bad guys, look like bad guys, smell like bad guys and general were bad guys but now they want to turn their lives around. Their first mission, as determined by the wolf, is to rescue 200 puppies from the city pound. The struggle to be good is ongoing throughout the book and it is this good verse evil type banter that makes this book so appealing and relevant to the 6-9 age group.
